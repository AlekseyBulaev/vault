Introduction

In a world overflowing with information, having a centralized repository for personal knowledge is crucial. This Personal Wiki is my attempt to create a space where I can capture insights, document solutions, and organize my thoughts. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute if you find something interesting or have insights to share.
Getting Started

To set up your own Personal Wiki:

bash

git clone https://github.com/AlekseyBulaev/vault.git
cd vault

Start adding your notes and content to the relevant folders.
Structure

The wiki is organized into folders based on different topics or categories. Each folder contains markdown files with notes, code snippets, and other relevant information. The goal is to create a structured and easily navigable knowledge base.
