**Docker** is a set of [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service "Platform as a service") (PaaS) products that use [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization "OS-level virtualization") to deliver software in packages called _[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization) "Container (virtualization)")_.

Docker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.
