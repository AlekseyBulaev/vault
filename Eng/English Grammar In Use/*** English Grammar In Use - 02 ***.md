## Unit 1 1 - How long have you (been) ... ?

>==[A] We use present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still continues now.==
>	Paul is in hospital.
>		but: He's been in hospital since Monday. (= He has been ...)
>		but: Do you know each other well? Have you know each other for a long time? (not Do you know)
>		but: She's waiting for somebody. She's been waiting all morning.
>		but: Do they have a car? How long have they had their car?

>==[B] When we ask or say 'how long', the continuous is more usual==:
>	I've been learning English for six months.
>	It's been raining since lunchtime.
>==Some verbs (for example, know/like/believe) are not normally used in the continuous==:
>	How long have you known Jane? (not have you been knowing)
>	I've had a pain in my stomach all day. (not I've been having)

>==[C] You can use either the present perfect continuous or simple with live and work==:
>	Julia has been living / has lived here for a long time.
>	How long have you been working / have you worked here?
>==But use the simple (I've lived / I've done etc.) with **always**==:
>	I've always lived in the country. (not always been living)

>==[D] We say 'I haven't done something since / for ...' (present perfect simple)==:
>	I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him)
>	Sarah hasn't phoned for ages. (= the last time she phoned was ages ago)

## Unit 12 - For and since When ... ? and How long ... ?

>==[A] We use **for** and **since** to say how long something has been happening.
>We use **for** + a period of time (**two hours, six weeks,** etc)==
>	I've been waiting for two hours
>**for**: two hours, a long time, a week, 20 minutes, six months, ages, five days, 50 years, years
>	Sally has been working here for six months. (not since six months)
>	I haven't seen Tom for three days.
>==We use **since** + start of a period (8 o'clock, Monday, 1999 etc)==:
>	I've been waiting since 8 o'clock.
>**since**: 8 o'clock, April, lunchtime, Monday, 2001, we arrived, 12 May, Christmas, I got up
>	Sally has been working here since April. (= from April until now)
>	I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
>==It is possible to leave out **for** (but not usually in negative sentences)==:
>	They've been married (for) ten years. (with or without **for**)
>	They **haven't had** a holiday **for** ten years. (you must use **for**)
>==We  do not use **for +all ... (all day / all my life etc.**)==:
>	I've lived here **all my life**. (not for all my life)
>==You can use **in** instead of **for** in negative sentences (**I haven't** ... etc.)==:
>	They **haven't had** a holiday **in ten years**. (= for ten years)

>==[B] Compare **when ... ?** (+past simple) and **how long ... ?** (+present perfect)==:
>	**When** did it start raining? It started raining **an hour ago / at 1 o'clock**.
>	**How long** has it been raining? It's been raining **for an hour / since 1 o'clock**.
>	**When** did Joe and Carol first meet? They first meet **a long time ago / when they were at school**.
>	**How long** have they known each other? They've known each other **for a long time / since they were at school.**

>==[C] We say==: 
>	**It's** six months since something happened (= it is)
>	**It's been** six months since something happened (= it has been)

## Unit 13 - Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)

>==[A] The present perfect (something **has happened**) is a present tense. It always tells us about situation now==. 'Tom **has lost** his key' = he doesn't have his key now
>==The past simple (something **happened**) tells us about the past==. If somebody says 'Tom **lost** his key', this doesn't tell us whether he has the key now or not. It tells us only that he lost his key at some rime in the past.
>==Do not use the present perfect if the situation now is different. Compare==:
>	They've gone away. They'll be back on Friday. (they are away now)
>	They wen away, but I think they're back at home now. (not They've gone)
>	I has stopped raining now, so we don't need the umbrella. (it isn't raining now)
>	It topped raining for a while, bit now it's raining again. (not it has stopped)

>==[B] You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings==:
>	I've repaired the washing machine. It's working OK now.
>	Sally has had a baby! It's a boy.
>==Usually, you can also use the past simple==:
>	I repaired the washing machine. It's working Ok now.
>==Use the past simple (not the present perfect) for things that are not recent or new==:
>	Mozart was a composer. He wrote more than 600 pieces pf music. (not has been ... has written)
>	My mother grew up in Italy. (not has grown)
>==Compare==:
>	Did you know that somebody has invented a new type of washing machine?
>	WHo invented the telephone? (not has invented)

>==[C] We use the present perfect to give new information. But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple==:
>	A: Ow! I've burnt myself.
>	B: How did you do that? (not have you done)
>	A: I picked up a hot dish. (not have picked)
>_
>	A:Look! Somebody has split something on the sofa.
>	B: Well, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. (not hasn't been ... haven't done)
