## Unit 1 1 - How long have you (been) ... ?

>==[A] We use present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still continues now.==

>==[B] When we ask or say 'how long', the continuous is more usual==:

>==Some verbs (for example, know/like/believe) are not normally used in the continuous==:
>	How long have you known Jane? (not have you been knowing)

>==[C] You can use either the present perfect continuous or simple with live and work==:

>	How long have you been working / have you worked here?
>==But use the simple (I've lived / I've done etc.) with **always**==:

>==[D] We say 'I haven't done something since / for ...' (present perfect simple)==:

>	Sarah hasn't phoned for ages. (= the last time she phoned was ages ago)

---

## Unit 12 - For and since When ... ? and How long ... ?

>==[A] We use **for** and **since** to say how long something has been happening.
>We use **for** + a period of time (**two hours, six weeks,** etc)==
>	I've been waiting for two hours
>**for**: two hours, a long time, a week, 20 minutes, six months, ages, five days, 50 years, years

>	They've been married (for) ten years. (with or without **for**)
>	They **haven't had** a holiday **for** ten years. (you must use **for**)
>==We  do not use **for +all ... (all day / all my life etc.**)==:

## Unit 13 - Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)

>==[A] The present perfect (something **has happened**) is a present tense. It always tells us about situation now==. 'Tom **has lost** his key' = he doesn't have his key now
>==The past simple (something **happened**) tells us about the past==. If somebody says 'Tom **lost** his key', this doesn't tell us whether he has the key now or not. It tells us only that he lost his key at some rime in the past.
>==Do not use the present perfect if the situation now is different. Compare==:
>	They've gone away. They'll be back on Friday. (they are away now)
>	They wen away, but I think they're back at home now. (not They've gone)
>	I has stopped raining now, so we don't need the umbrella. (it isn't raining now)
>	It topped raining for a while, bit now it's raining again. (not it has stopped)

>==[B] You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings==:
>	I've repaired the washing machine. It's working OK now.
>	Sally has had a baby! It's a boy.
>==Usually, you can also use the past simple==:
>	I repaired the washing machine. It's working Ok now.
>==Use the past simple (not the present perfect) for things that are not recent or new==:
>	Mozart was a composer. He wrote more than 600 pieces pf music. (not has been ... has written)
>	My mother grew up in Italy. (not has grown)
>==Compare==:
>	Did you know that somebody has invented a new type of washing machine?
>	WHo invented the telephone? (not has invented)

>==[C] We use the present perfect to give new information. But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple==:
>	A: Ow! I've burnt myself.
>	B: How did you do that? (not have you done)
>	A: I picked up a hot dish. (not have picked)
>_
>	A:Look! Somebody has split something on the sofa.
>	B: Well, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. (not hasn't been ... haven't done)

## Unit 14 - Present perfect and past 2 (I have done and I did)

>==[A] Do not use the present perfect (**I have done**) when you talk about a finished time (for example, **yesterday / ten minutes ago / in 2005 / when I was a child**). Use a past tense==:
>	It was very cold yesterday. (not has been)
>	Paul and Lucy arrived ten minutes ago. (not have arrived)
>	Did you eat a lot of sweets when you were a child? (not have you eaten)
>==use the past to ask **When** ... ? or **What time** .. ?==:
>	When did your friends arrive? (not have ... arrived)
>	What time did you finish work?
>==Compare==:
>Present perfect:
>	Tom has lost his key. He can't get into the house.
>	Is Carla here or has she left?
>Past simple:
>	Tom lost his key yesterday. He couldn't get into the house.
>	When did Carla leave?

>==[B] We use the present perfect for a period of time that continues until now. For example: **today / this week / since 2007**==.
>	I hasn't rained this week
>	Have you seen Anna this morning? (it is still morning)
>	Have you seen Tim recently?
>	I don't know where Lisa is. I haven't seen her. (= I haven't seen her recently)
>	I have never played golf. (in my life)
>==We use the past simple for a finished time in the past. For example: yesterday / last week / from 2007 to 2010==.
>	It didn't rain last week.
>	Did you see Anna this morning? (it is now afternoon or evening)
>	Did you see Tim on Sunday?
>	Was Lisa at the party on Sunday?
>	We waited (or were waiting) for an hour. (we are no longer waiting)

## Unit 15 - Past perfect (I had done)

>==[A] The past perfect simple is **had** + past participle (**gone / seen / finished** etc).== 
>Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past:
>	Sara arrived at the party.
>This is the staring point of the story. Then, if we want to talk about things that happened before this time, we use the past perfect (**had** ...):
>	When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.
>Some more examples:
>	When we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.
>	Karen didn't want to go the cinema with us because she'd already seen the movie.

>	The house is dirty. They haven't cleaned it for weeks.
>Past perfect:

>	We weren't hungry. We'd just had lunch.
>	The house was dirty. They hadn't cleaned it for weeks.

>==[C] Compare the past simple (**left, was** etc.) and the past perfect (**had left, had been** etc.)==:
>Past simple:
>	A: Was Tom there when you arrived?
>	B: Yes, but he left soon afterwards
>	Kate wan't at home when I phoned. She was at her mother's house.
>Past perfect:
>	A: Was Tom there when you arrived?
>	B: No, he had already left.
